# GO-GUI

The idea of ​​this repository is to explore the GUIs available for Goang and get an idea of ​​which is the best option for each future project.

Recently at work I had to make a GUI in go and it was hard for me to decide on a library among the many that I found.

Based om the popular QT:
https://github.com/therecipe/qt  (Is the mos complete) (I find it interesting that "therecipe" has Pinned Flutter,yes I can't help but mention it I like flutter lol!)

https://github.com/go-qml/qml It is a very good option that I would like to remember in case in the future I have a designer on the team who works with QT DS.

*The bad thing about these libraries is that since they are based on QT, the license does not allow you to use the dynamic library or pay for the license to be able to use the static library.*

https://fyne.io/ I think it's the best option to do something fast and completely portable.

https://gioui.org/ Well, it was a good option, but I ruled it out because some details made me not decide on it.

https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go Although it is a library for making games, it works very well for conventional GUIs.
